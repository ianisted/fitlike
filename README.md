## CHALLENGE

Our team decided to build a website/app that encourages people to take part in local fitness activites. We are using the open Match The City dataset to drive our project.


## RESULTS

We broke into three sub-groups to design the user interface, build the front-end, and write the code to drive the backend.

### Design

Our new UI was taking steps forward in appearance and ease of use.
Version 1 of our new accessible UI, designed by Stuart.

Stuart is making big improvements to the interface and the final version may look quite different.


### Front-end

Our initial front-end was built by Angela and Stephen and provides a rough idea of the path the user will take.

This interface needs to be integrated into the back-end to build the prototype, and will be replaced with a working version of Stuart's UI.


### Back-end

The back-end was built by Ian Isted and Billy Fagan, and pulls large datasets from Match The City based on effort rating.

The back-end needs to be integrated into the front-end, and will need some re-writing due it being quickly thrown together. We also need to filter the data by activity type.

### Reports

Our first round of questions identified things for us to consider, or might be important to users of the system.

- Get older people active in new ways
- Make site easy for older people
- Popularity/amount of people going bar
- People with depression (getting depressed people on walks and what not) walk database.
- Wildlife? Parent and child experience
- School experience?
- Budget issues are important
- Dog poo is a huge issue apparently.
